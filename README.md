## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to run / test locally

There are two common ways to run or preview the project locally:

Option A ‚Äî Load as an unpacked Chrome extension (recommended)
1. Open Chrome (or any Chromium browser).
2. Go to chrome://extensions and enable "Developer mode".
3. Click "Load unpacked" and select the project folder (the root of this repository).
4. Open a new tab (or chrome-extension://[your-extension-id]/newtab.html) to preview.

Option B ‚Äî Quick local preview (non-extension)
1. Run a simple local web server from the project root. Examples:
   - Python 3: `python3 -m http.server 8000`
   - Node (if installed): `npx http-server -p 8000`
2. Open http://localhost:8000/newtab.html in your browser.

Notes:
- When using Option B you won't get extension-specific APIs, but the UI/UX and visuals will render for development and styling.
- For extension packaging, make sure `manifest.json` has the correct "action" / override for the New Tab if intended.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Background/star options and performance tips

This project supports a few background approaches (choose whichever best fits your performance needs):

- Canvas (default historical approach) ‚Äî [`vendor/star.js`](vendor/star.js:1). It can be resource-intensive on some devices. The file in this repo has been optimized with capped DPR, offscreen pre-rendering and lower particle counts to reduce CPU/GPU work.
- SVG (inline) ‚Äî lightweight, scalable, accessible; minimal JS required. See `newtab.html` for an inline SVG starfield example.
- Pure CSS (fallback) ‚Äî uses layered radial-gradients and repeating patterns in [`css/main.css`](css/main.css:100) for the lowest runtime cost (no JS).

Recommendation: For best performance on low-end devices, use the CSS option or the optimized canvas with DPR cap enabled.

## üõ† Development notes

- Quotes live under [`database/quotes`](database/quotes/index.js:1). Add or edit category files to change content.
- Themes and user preferences are handled in [`vendor/main.js`](vendor/main.js:1) and persisted to chrome.storage-like helpers (`vendor/chromeStorageHelper.js`:1).
- If you change `vendor/star.js` and want to test instantly, reload the extension in chrome://extensions or refresh the open new tab page.
